I have written this file for an assignment, highlighting information and pictures about myself.  It is written in HTML using Visual Studio Code.

Website Design
The CSS is included in an external file, as per professional practice.
The flexbox layout framework has been used for the structure of the webpage, because of this the webpage is mobile and app responsive.  ‘Newer’ HTML tags compatibility was checked using caniuse.com 
 
CSS flexbox layout allows you to easily format HTML. Flexbox makes it simple to align items vertically and horizontally using rows and columns. Items will "flex" to different sizes to fill the space. It makes responsive design easier. (Carnes 2019)

Accessibility
The fonts were chosen in accordance with ADA compliance standards. Using ADA compliant fonts during the web design process ensures that your content is easier to read, your site navigation is convenient, and that assistive technology such as screen readers functions as it should (Visser 2024).
Colour can be ornamental, can help to establish a visual identity, and can have practical value (red might draw attention to important information) (Anderson 2021).
Accessibility was also a factor when choosing the colours.  I have used colours which have been taken from the design website flatuicolors.com using their Aussie palette selection. These were selected by a graphic designer, and I have combined this with Githubs Accessible color palette builder which has selected the correct combinations of text and background colours to adhere to contrast principles.

Images were used and were checked using Vischeck.  This online tool (also available as a Photoshop plugin for Windows) allows you to upload an image file and check the suitability of graphics and text. This tool can show you what your image looks like to people who are colour blind, people with glaucoma or macular degeneration, elders and children (Anderson 2021).

Animations in the form of Gifs were used.  Animations can be used to enhance content by presenting media content or by focusing attention on important content. An animated graphic may present a sequence of images that convey content that cannot adequately be presented by one static image (WebAIM 2020).

In regards to modern innovations included in this site, I have included the use of flexbox to make the website mobile responsive; embedding of a clickable social media account and embedding a youtube video which was sized to fit the page of my website.

If anybody in the community has images of me, feel free to place them into the public repository, so I can review them before adding them to the website.
Any suggestions and tips to improve the website from the community are welcomed via the  social media account on my webpage or by email. 

Known errors – the 2 images in flexbox 5 are not mobile responsive.
